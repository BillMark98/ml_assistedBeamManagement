# About

* This is the code related  to the thesis found in [mastherThesis](./masterThesisEE_panwei.pdf)

* The general idea is to use Machine Learning Technique to help the Beam Management Initial Access stage
in 5G network.

* Three Methods are implemented, which are termed position-based, single-stage, and two-stage


* The folder can be divided into two parts, the first [dataProcess](./dataProcess/) relates to the processing of matlab folder
the second [trainCode](./trainCode/) relates to the training, so where the game begins.


***IMPORTANT!*** 

* The data are available in the server of the iNets intstitue bowie server, under the path
`/storage/archive/Panwei/DATA/`. If you are interested, please contact the colleague in the institute, [Aleksandar Ichkov](mailto:aic@inets.rwth-aachen.de) for more information.

## dataProcess

this is for generate the data matrix


## trainCode

this is where the training begins, check [README](./trainCode/READEME.md), to help you get a flavor, a mock 
dataset is provided in the [dataFolder/dataMatrixAll_tx1_mock_8.csv](./trainCode/dataFolder/dataMatrixAll_tx1_mock_8.csv)
